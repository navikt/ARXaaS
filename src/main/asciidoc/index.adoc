= ARX as a Service

[[overview-introduction]]
== Introduction

ARX as a Service is a Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet) bachelor thesis project completed in cooperation with
Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The project aims to make ARX features and functionality available
as a micro service. To deliver on this goal the bachelor team decided to create a web service implemented with
Spring boot which exposes ARX functionality as a RESTful API. Users can then either use the companion packages
and clients developed by the team to interact the web service or create their own clients.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs. The service utilizes the following HTTP verbs on the endpoints.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve metrics and logging data

| `POST`
| Used for requests to analyze, anonymize or generate generalization hierarchies
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.


|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===


[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/root/response-headers.adoc[]


[[resources]]
= Resources



[[resources-index]]
== Index

The index provides the entry point into the service.



[[resources-index-access]]
=== Accessing the index

A `GET` request is used to access the index

operation::root[snippets='http-response,links']


[[analyze-controller]]
== Analyze Controller

The Analyze controller is used to generate risk profiles for a dataset. The REST controller receives a request object
containing a dataset to be analyzed and the attribute type list of the dataset. The Controller returns an response object
containing a risk profile that includes the re-identification risk and distribution of risk in a dataset.


[[analyze-controller-post]]
=== Generating a Risk profile

A `POST` request is used to generate a risk profile

operation::analyze-controller[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']


[[anonymize-controller]]
== Anonymize Controller

The Anonymize controller is used to create new dataset anonymized according to provided privacy models and
transformation models. The controller receives a request object containing a dataset to be anonymized, list of
attribute types containing transformation models(hierarchies) and privacy models. The controller returns an response
object containing a anonymized dataset, a risk profile, and metadata for the anonymization process.


[[anonymize-controller-post]]
=== Creating a Anonymized Dataset

A `POST` request is used to create a new anonymized dataset

operation::anonymize-controller[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']


[[hierarchy-controller]]
== Hierarchy Controller

The hierarchy controller provides a interface to access ARX hierarchy builder features. The controller receives a request object
containing the dataset column to create the hierarchy for, the builder type and builder specific attributes. The controller
returns a response object containing the resulting hierarchy.

Currently the following builders are supported:

 - Redaction based
 - Interval based
 - Order based

=== Create a redaction based hierarchy

This method builds hierarchies for categorical and non-categorical values using redaction. Dataset items are:

 1. aligned left-to-right or right-to-left,
 2. differences in length are filled with a padding character.
 3. Equally long values are redacted, character by character from left-to-right or right-to-left.

=== Create a interval based hierarchy

This method builds hierarchies for non-categorical values by mapping them into given intervals.

operation::hierarchy-controller-intervalbased[snippets='request-fields,http-request,http-response']

=== Create a order based hierarchy

This method builds hierarchies for categorical and non-categorical values by ordering the dataset items and merging them
into groups with the defined sizes.

operation::hierarchy-controller-orderbased[snippets='request-fields,http-request,http-response']

=== Create a date based hierarchy

This method builds hierarchies for date values following Java SimpleDateFormat.
