= ARX as a Service

[[overview-introduction]]
== Introduction

ARX as a Service is a Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet) bachelor thesis project completed in cooperation with
Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The project aims to make ARX features and functionality available
as a Python package. To deliver on this goal the bachelor team decided to create a web service implemented with
Spring boot which exposes ARX functionality as a RESTful API. Users can then either use the companion Python package
developed by the team to consume the web service or create their own clients.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a metrics and logging data

| `POST`
| Used to analyze and or anonymize a request
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful notes tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.


|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===


[[overview-headers]]
== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/root/response-headers.adoc[]


[[resources]]
= Resources



[[resources-index]]
== Index

The index provides the entry point into the service.



[[resources-index-access]]
=== Accessing the index

A `GET` request is used to access the index

operation::root[snippets='response-fields,http-response,links']


[[analyze-controller]]
== Analyze Controller

The Analyze controller is used to generate risk profiles for a dataset. The REST controller receives a request object
containing a dataset to be analyzed and the attribute type list of the dataset. The Controller returns an response object
containing a risk profile that includes the re-identification risk and distribution of risk in a dataset.


[[analyze-controller-post]]
=== Generating a Risk profile

A `POST` request is used to generate a risk profile

operation::analyze-controller[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']


[[anonymize-controller]]
== Anonymize Controller

The Anonymize controller is used to create new dataset anonymized according to provided privacy models and
transformation models. The controller receives a request object containing a dataset to be anonymized, list of
attribute types containing transformation models(hierarchies) and privacy models. The controller returns an response
object containing a anonymized dataset, a risk profile, and metadata for the anonymization process.


[[anonymize-controller-post]]
=== Creating a Anonymized Dataset

A `POST` request is used to create a new anonymized dataset

operation::anonymize-controller[snippets='request-fields,curl-request,http-response']


[[hierarchy-controller]]
== Hierarchy Controller

The hierarchy controller provides a interface to access ARX hierarchy builder features. The controller receives a request object
containing the dataset column to create the hierarchy for, the builder type and builder specific attributes. The controller
returns a response object containing the resulting hierarchy.

Currently the following builders are supported:

 - Redaction based
 - Interval based
 - Order based

=== Create a redaction based hierarchy
operation::hierarchy-controller-redactionbased[snippets='request-fields,http-request,http-response']

=== Create a interval based hierarchy
operation::hierarchy-controller-intervalbased[snippets='request-fields,http-request,http-response']
